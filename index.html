        		<h1>Welcome to TACCs' Smart City Hackathon 2021!</h1>
				<p>The Good System is proud to present the first Smart City Hackathon. In collaboration with Pecan Street and the City of Austin, this Smart City Hackathon aims to bring together machine learning enthusiasts to build ideas for Smart Cities that focus on improving sustainability of smart energy and water usage. 

This virtual hackathon will take place during the first two Saturdays in April. Pre the hackathon event, A series of optional training sessions will be provided during March. After the hackathon, a virtual award presentation will be scheduled and open to the public to honor all participants.  

Each participating team will get a prize! Total awards are up to $2,000!

We believe technology should be built by people with different backgrounds and perspectives. Weâ€™d love to have a diverse, comfortable creative and a fun learning environment for everyone!

We welcome all interested undergraduate students to sign up as a team member and interested individuals with postgraduate degrees to sign up as a mentor. We will assign all interested participants into teams. Each team will consist of 3 ~ 4 team members and one mentor.
